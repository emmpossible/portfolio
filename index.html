                      As stated on their own website, The Good Sam Insurance Agency is focused on making RVing more enjoyable and safer - all while saving RVers money. Good Sam RV Insurance Agency brought our team in to help redesign their old, unresponsive website. While their content writer worked on wording, I was in charge of redesigning all of their pages.

                <p>
                    Following their brand guidelines, I came up with several different home page concepts to match their colors while giving their customers the various environments while they travel in their RVs as well as filling them in on Good Sam’s excellent reviews through their BirdEye application integrated into the website. Once approved, I worked alongside their content writer to come up with the various inner pages for their website.

                <p>
                    Along with the various layouts, I was also in charge of coming up with icons to help customers browse the website. I designed various RV icons – from illustrating the different RV categories to pointing out different ways various insurance coverages from Good Sam can protect their customers’ RV.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the designs were approved, I packaged the Photoshop and iconography files and sent them over to Good Sam’s development team.

                    Fleet Feet is a store where runners, walkers and fitness enthusiasts of all abilities receive unparalleled service and support. Fleet Feet St. Louis has an amazing training center and needed material to help inform the public of all of the training programs, classes and various physical assessments they could participate in right in their own backyard. I worked with a content writer and Fleet Feet’s Running Club manager to design an informational booklet with different sections for their various activities.

                <p>
                    After the content writer wrote the first draft and the manager approved, I went about coming up with the design concept for all of the different pages with photos that either I or a professional photographer shot as well as vector shapes to help create a sense of movement. Fleet Feet St. Louis’s brand included bright orange, blues and reds – I included these colors to help organize the various sections for readers.

                <p>
                   Once the concept was created, I worked with the content writer to make sure the content fit and read well with the imagery. When that was completed, I sent over the new concept to the Running Club manager for approval. After approval, I packaged the InDesign document with the fonts and imagery used and sent it to a professional printing service.

                    The Springfield Sliders needed material to advertise their new service. With their brand colors, I came up with a variety of materials the team could using iconography of various objects including baseball hats, helmets, and other related items. I stuck with darker colors for the icons where they were still easy to visualize from the background, but gave the bright green and white color to the content to help it stand out to baseball fans at the field.

                     Kira-Mar is a beautiful villa just minutes away from the beaches of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Our team, GoWeb1, was put in charge of photography and recreating their website to make it more unique and responsive.

                    During our stay at Kira-Mar we were able to take photos of the outside private area for villa visitors, the variously decorated rooms, the boat slips and some of the various restaurants in the area.

                <p>
                    Once we returned from our trip, we were able to design the website and resize the photos for web use. In the design for Kira-Mar I went for a tropical, modern vibe while using warm colors to help customers feel the warmth of Florida. All photos used on the website were from our team’s trip to help the website feel more personal and unique from its competitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                      Kira-Mar also wanted a new logo. The two palm trees represent the Fort Lauderdale beaches, and the cursive, slanted font was used to help keep the villa’s charm.

                      Rate5 was created to help businesses reach out to their customers to get positive reviews on their experiences, and to help push those positive reviews onto social media platforms. They wanted a modern website that heavily used photos and imagery to show off their platform.

                      D&S Builders works include new construction, major additions and home renovations, and they strive to add value and functionality in their workmanship. Owners Dan and Tod needed a redesign from their static website as well as a content upgrade. I worked together with our team’s content writer to help recreate a look that would match their brand.

                <p>
                    I created a mobile-friendly design to help highlight D&S Builder’s new construction and remodeling process using colors and spacing used in their previous marketing. We updated the navigation to highlight their photo gallery, customer reviews and designed a timeline to help walk visitors through the D&S Builders’ process for both new construction as well as remodeling.
